						<p>Hi, I'm Junwen. I'm a Web Developer and Experience Designer.</p>
						<p>I think design and development are both essential in delivering solutions to users, in which one could not exist without the other. Iâ€™m passionate about building empathy with people, and designing satisfying experiences for them. I also enjoy developing a lot as it makes things happen and brings design to life.</p>
						<p>My skills cross a broad range and I'm always up for learning new things.</p>
